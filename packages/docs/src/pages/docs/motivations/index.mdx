# Motivations

CSS it's known to be `complicated`, but those how dedicated their time to it,
may have realized that actually is `too wide`.
By saying it I meant that, for support reasons, CSS had to `accumulate` multiple
ways do to the same things, which makes it `less intuitive`.

Another characteristic of CSS that contributes for its infamous reputation, it's `scalability`.
If you ever have worked in a medium/big project with just with HTML, CSS and JS, without any `frameworks` or `libs`,
you probably had issues with it. Even at small teams respecting the `DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)` concept it's a challenge.
There're `pattern` solutions for class creation, but still demands a lot of effort and communication,
which can be `unfeasible` at scenarios with third party teams.

# Inspirations

## Utility classes

It's a way of building `CSS classes` focused on the functionality, or `utility`,
of one or more style attributes, which produce a `specific result` and reusable.

Among its advantages are the reduction of `redundancy` of styles, `declarative` use and `reusability`,
reducing the creation of classes for primitive functionalities.

One of the greatest `examples` of utility-first CSS frameworks is [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/).
You may took it for granted at first glace, but it did an `remarkable` job of `compiling relevant css` and
has an awesome `documentation`. Solving the issues of `scalability` and `wideness`, pointed [above](#Motivations).

```html
<div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6">
  <img class="h-16 w-16" src="avatar.jpg" />
  <div>
    <h2>Erin Lindford</h2>
    <div>Product Engineer</div>
    <div>erinlindford@example.com</div>
    <div>(555) 765-4321</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## CSS-in-JS

One of the most difficult things about programming is `naming things` and it's no different with css classes.
So, what if we `delegate` it to JavaScript. Why stop there?
What if, in addition to it, we simplified `logic transitions of styles` using JS.

That's basically my view of the main strengths of this approach of using JavaScript to handle styles.
Notorious examples are [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

Both of those libs have a styled feature that 

```tsx
export const Text = styled.span`
  ${({ color }) => color && `color: ${color};`}
`;
```
